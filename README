sidekiq_retry_alert.rb: Ruby script to send a slack message about sidekiq jobs that are retried too many times for comfort.

Usage: sidekiq_retry_alert.rb /path/of/state_file retry_count_threshold

Script is supposed to run frequently via cron or something similar, I recommend every 10-15m. It uses the temporary state file to record the last run so only changes in state will be reported. 

retry_count_threshold: it's common that intermittent issues would make a sidekiq job fail and get retried, and Sidekiq can do that automatically. But if a job keeps failing over and over, it's good to know about it.

The script depends on the REDIS_URL environmental variable to connect to the right Sidekiq redis queue. It also uses the SLACKWEBHOOK variable to send the alerts to.

A second script sidekiq_retry_daily_report.rb runs a general report of how many different kinds of jobs are in the retry queue. It also uses REDIS_URL and SLACKWEBHOOK.
